### Make Change Project

#### Description
This is a program to calculate the change given for merchant processing at a business point of sale. My program will have an input for amount of transaction and amount paid. It will then calculate the total change, and denominations of currency handed back to the customer.

#### Lessons learned

I set this code up with while loops and if statements. Although this helped me visualize the results, it used a lot of code. Else/if statements probably would have been better. It also caused an issue with being a penny short of some calculations. The TA's helped me work through this issue.
